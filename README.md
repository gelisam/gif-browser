![a screenshot of the application](screenshot.png)

The pink region is meant to be keyed out (made transparent) by a screen capture application such as [OBS](https://obsproject.com/). Outside the captured region, the giant square brackets indicate whether this is the first and/or last image in the animation.

I wrote this small application live at https://twitch.com/gelisam, [here is the recording](https://youtu.be/xizwLjCHO1Y).
